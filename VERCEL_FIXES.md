# Vercel Deployment Fixes

## ✅ FIXED: API Connection Issue
The frontend was trying to connect to `http://localhost:5000/api` instead of the production backend.

### Solution Applied:
1. Set `VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api` in `school_store_frontend/.env.production`
2. Fixed import order in `api/index.py` to ensure proper module loading

## Next Steps for Deployment

### 1. Redeploy to Vercel
```bash
# Deploy with the fixed configuration
vercel --prod
```

Or if you have automatic deployments from GitHub:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix API URL configuration for Vercel deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Verify the Fix
After deployment, check:
1. **Visit your site** and open browser console (F12)
2. **Look for**: `[Constants] Final API_BASE_URL: /api` (not localhost)
3. **Test login** with credentials:
   - Username: `teacher1`
   - Password: `password123`

### 3. If You See Environment Variable Issues
Make sure Vercel doesn't have conflicting environment variables:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Remove any `VITE_API_BASE_URL` that points to localhost or Render
3. Keep only the database-related environment variables:
   - `DATABASE_URL` (your PostgreSQL connection string)
   - `SECRET_KEY` (for session management)

## Expected Behavior

When working correctly:
1. Frontend at `/` should load the login page
2. API calls should go to `/api/*` (same domain)
3. No CORS errors
4. Console should show: `[Constants] Final API_BASE_URL: /api`

## Test Credentials
- Username: `teacher1`
- Password: `password123`

## API Health Check
You can test if the API is working by visiting:
- https://school-store-source-code-ogws2n7d7-nicks-projects-4faac881.vercel.app/api/health

This should return a 401 (which is expected without authentication).

## If API Not Working

Check the Function logs in Vercel dashboard:
1. Go to your project dashboard
2. Click on "Functions" tab
3. Check for any errors in the logs

## Configuration Summary

### What Was Fixed:

#### 1. Frontend Configuration (`school_store_frontend/.env.production`)
```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=/api
```
This ensures the frontend uses `/api` which Vercel routes to your backend.

#### 2. Backend Configuration (`api/index.py`)
- Fixed import order to ensure modules load correctly
- Path setup happens before importing the Flask app
- Database defaults to SQLite if DATABASE_URL not set

### How It Works:
1. **Frontend** makes API calls to `/api/*` (same domain)
2. **Vercel** routes `/api/*` requests to the Python serverless function
3. **Backend** handles requests via Flask app in `api/index.py`

## Database Note
Make sure your DATABASE_URL is correctly set in Vercel environment variables.
If using SQLite for testing, it will reset on each deployment.
